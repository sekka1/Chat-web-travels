**Duration:** Free Tour CDMX, Av "El Paseo de la Reforma"5.00(2)3 hoursJona&Vale ToursPay what you wishFree Tour

**Rating:** 5.00

**Description:** Hello and welcome to CDMX! We are Vale and Jona, we will be your guides on this exciting and mysterious tour along the most emblematic avenue in the city. Places we will visit on the tour: We begin the tour at the sculpture of Tlaloc next to the Anthropology Museum on Avenida Reforma, where I will briefly tell you about Pre-Hispanic History, we will walk through a part of Chapultepec Forest, where we will find archaeological remains and finally we will visit the most important part of Avenida Reforma to learn the details of its buildings and monuments. Content rich tour with City native Valeria this afternoon in perfect walking weather!  She’s very knowledgeable about the City’s history and peppers her remarks at each stop with local legends and back stories.  Very personable guide and went longer to make sure she had covered all of the spots when I missed the  starting point and turned out to be the only one. Pointed out items in the Park I know would have otherwise missed, and shared many illustrative photos on her tablet.  Even provided a restroom stop and coin to enter! 
Highly recommend the tour and especially Valeria!
