Content rich tour with City native Valeria this afternoon in perfect walking weather!  She’s very knowledgeable about the City’s history and peppers her remarks at each stop with local legends and back stories.  Very personable guide and went longer to make sure she had covered all of the spots when I missed the  starting point and turned out to be the only one. Pointed out items in the Park I know would have otherwise missed, and shared many illustrative photos on her tablet.  Even provided a restroom stop and coin to enter! \nHighly recommend the tour and especially Valeria!",
