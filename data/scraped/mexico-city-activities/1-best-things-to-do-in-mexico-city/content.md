You will find this little abode, which is now the Frida Kahlo Museum ‘Casa Azul’, in Coyoacán, her favorite neighborhood. Not only does it safeguard her most cherished works of art, such as Viva la Vida and Frida y su cesárea, but it also is home to her diaries, clothes, and even the artist’s bed. If you look closely, you will find her ashes in what was her bedroom. Gloomy, right?
